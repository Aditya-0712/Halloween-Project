# Halloween-Project
Hello !! 
This my first ever project on GitHub and I don't have much idea about GitHub
This basically is a Halloween themed store website which i made as a project 
to submit to w3schools November Halloween event on their Discord server.
To access the project you first have to open "Halloween_Login.html"
Again! I'm very new to this
